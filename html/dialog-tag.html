  <p>A narrative chronicle of Israeli democracy that defines historic phases and follows thematic challenges to democracy, including: competition between religion 
    and the rule of law; the statist society and chaotic minoritocracy; modern illiberal populism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The comprehensive portrait
     exposes endemic flaws of democracy in Israel, but also shows that Israel has considerable capacity – and responsibility – to fulfill the promise of democracy.</p>
